I love the beginning. It’s the most uncertain and scary place to be. It’s the place I think more people should spend more time.

I try to keep things in perspective, and realize that regardless of what I think there’s a lot of people that struggle to start new things. 

And, with more perspective, I know a lot of those people struggle to build useful and helpful products, in a methodology that will most likely lead to success. I’ve noticed that most people start with a methodology that will almost certainly lead to failure (myself included).

With even more perspective, I realize that people WANT to build products more **now** than **ever**.

So with all that perspective, I hope to iterate over them, with my personal perspective as the base case, and let each step build up a better world-view, that can help other people. It’s powerful, that’s why I love perspective. 

```ruby
# E.g.
[@perspectives].inject({personal}) do |perspective|
	world_view_built from: perspective
end
```

The most important part of this, is tweaking what goes in the @perspectives array at the beginning. 

I’ve noticed, with me, this iteration can run out of control when the wrong steps are iterated over. For instance, with negativity, if we let negativity (ours or others) stick around in the @perspectives array, you will be destroyed as the iterations of your brain continue. It builds and builds and basically has to lead to some sort of implosion. A lot of times that implosion leads to medical issues - has happened to me many times. 
 And even more-so, I let that iteration of negativity stop me from doing anything on my own for the past 5 years.

But, I’ve changed the perspectives array, and filled it with things to build a more positive and empowering world view. We can save the details for another post, but with this new worldview, I can actually build things and launch things and not be stalled out (professionally I’ve been busier than ever - this stalling really only applied to my personal business).

So, to start with, I’m building a SAAS app. 

As a _byproduct_ of the app, I’ll be releasing free articles the entire time as we go (with screenshots and code samples), and a free Ruby on Rails course + React/Redux course. It will be free forever. I also hope to release an ebook on writing applications. I’ve built more and refactored more long-lasting production Ruby code than most people on the Earth, so I have plenty of qualifications to do so. 

As for the SAAS component, I’ve done this sass thing 3-5 times in businesses, & the last one I built made millions/year and I was the sole backend developer (& front-end). Unfortunately that was for a company with no rev share, so I don’t have any resources now from that entropy I pushed against for 5 years back then. Even co-founding a company didn’t leave me with resources because I was financially and legally illiterate when I was younger, but that’s all fixed now w/that experience.

So, this time I want to do it on my own. 

## Why build this thing

It will be harder, but if I can make any money with a SASS app, I can contribute back to the developer community (my favorite community and the community I come from). 

I want to invest in people to allow them to build THEIR dream apps (even if that just means helping them take some time off work to build it). 

Also, I have a lot to make up for. I made a lot of mistakes in my first year of business in 2015 - that I still haven’t addressed - by not fulfilling promises I made. 

To honor those people, I’ll be giving this SASS app & all other things I make to a the 400 people that bought my course previously, for free, forever. If you ever bought anything from me, and you’re reading this, you fall into that group. I have a soft-skills course (that helped me get to CTO), the previously mentioned Ruby course, and a programming patterns course (that helped me refactor multiple world-famous large-scale apps) that you’ll get for free as well (upon other things).

I know that will **start** to make up promises I didn’t deliver on in the past - as technically the value of these is higher than the $29/$69 price of my course. 

So that’s the first part of my motivation for building a SAAS app. 1) The app is needed (see previous post HERE) 2) I need to give back to the community with something valuable 3) The byproducts can help thousands of developers and managers and 4) The app will allow people to build complex apps that could never do it before. 

The next part of my motivation for this, is the second phase of the SASS app rollout - where I want to move beyond my initial niche to something more interesting. 

## So what is this thing

There are 2 phases for the core product, with sub-phases below them. 

Podvio will be the phase 1 brand.

Phase 1.1 “Podcast Backend as a Service” will allow developers to call an API that I provide, that allows them to use podcast app data “in the cloud” or “as a service”, and allows them to build a podcast app in 20% of time it took to previously build a podcast / audio app. 

Phase 1.2 will allow developers to call the API via our SDK library that contains an SDK for your app, in 5+ languages (Swift, Kotlin, ECMA6/CoffeeScript 2/TypeScript, etc). Pick and choose what you need.

Phase 1.3 will allow developers to `subscribe` to podcasts, and provide an API for us to use as a callback or web-hook, to push you data. This converts us from a push model in 1.1 to push model in 1.3. 

Phase 2 is where things get a lot more interesting.

There are only 500-2000 developers of podcast applications in the world, and if audio that goes to 5-20k. Problem is, that’s not a huge market for an app (it’s not about money, it’s about size of contribution or value).

Phase 2 abstracts this concept from the podcasts niche to a backend with long-running process capability for almost any app type across any industry.

Actly.Cloud will be the phase 2 brand. 

We want any app to be able to create a “cloud” and act on it, for their app, and that cloud will allow them to abstract out complex backend problems. Think of it like Amazon/Netlify functions, or lambda, or automated workflows, but on steroids, with less configuration needed, and far more integration with your application (and a white glove integration for companies that need it).

## Idc about that right now, what are you launching with?

In Phase 1.1-1.3 the push/pull model will be integrated with the following options.

The companies and developers can choose to get the results back in 2 different ways:

1. Phase 1.1 - Pull: They can get data back from the subsystem immediately with a specific API call, creating a polling mechanism. 
2. Phase 1.3 - Push: They can send through an API callback / web-hook that I can call with the data, creating a pushing mechanism.

The initial API and subsystem is actually a few subsystems (a crawler, and a data subsystem), but it’s  best to think of it as “Podcast Backend as a Service”.

## What is it not?

It’s not a podcast CMS - for that check out [anchor.fm] or [fireside.fm], those are great solutions and already solved problems. 

It’s not a podcast app generator, but for that you can use #nocode solutions (more posts on this as we get there), and we will integrate with them.

It won’t be a heavy UI app initially, and mostly will work via an API. BUT, there will be a UI to build your connection to our API in a web interface, but again, preferred interaction will be via our API.

## Why am I the right person to do this? 

I’ve personally been rebuilding these subsystems over and over, to industry acclaim (our companies listed as Most Innovative in FastCompany for years), for 9 years and I’m one of the most qualified in the world - so why not? 
 You may not like me, because of the problems I’ve had in the past with my previous course, but you have to admit I know what I’m doing in this area and I’m qualified to do this. 

I will also win you over by giving back to you, for years and years, for free, whilst maintaining a high level of personal integrity by ONLY committing to things I can do.
