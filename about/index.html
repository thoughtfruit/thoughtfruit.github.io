	    <p><a href="https://rubyonrails.org">StartHereFM</a> is a media business that's focused on helping people learn new skills in the technology field. I created StartHereFM in 2014 following my experience as a <a href="http://pif.gov">Presidential Innovation Fellow</a> and continue to post episodes on platforms like <a href="https://youtube.com/startherefm">youtube</a> and <a href="http://soundcloud.com/starthere-webdev">apple podcasts</a>.</p>

	    <h2 id="rails">Creator of Open Opportunities</h2>
			
			<!-- INSERT IMAGE HERE  -->
			
	    <p>The <a href="https://rubyonrails.org">Open Opportunities Platform</a> is an open-source platform that was built to allow Government agencies to collaborate on projects. </p>
				
				<p>The goal is to allow Government agencies to break out of the top-down silos where they only collaborate with other people in their agency, and allow for cross-agency productivity.</p>
			
			<p>I architected and built the first version with a co-creator, and continue to be an active member in the open source development thereof (albeit not as much lately).</p>
			
			<p>Since it's roll-out in 2014, it's been very successful. For example: we allowed the CIA to collaborate with Embassy staff in Iran & Africa, while they both work with the Red Cross and Department of State to get a project across the finish line. In the private sector, this seems completely normal, but this is a radical of a transformation for the US Government. </p>

	    <p>Hundreds of programmers have contributed to the ecosystem of development needs via <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>, and served as the impetus for the founding of the <a href="http://18f.gov">18F Government Agency</a> and the <a href="http://usds.gov">United States Digital Service</a>.

	    <h2 id="basecamp">Founder & CTO at thoughtfruit</h2>
	    <p>We make software for the web at <a href="http://www.thoughtfruit.ml">thoughtfruit</a>. Our most popular product is <a href="">GoodPods</a>, a self-hosted podcast management and library application that provides a non self-hosted client to go with the experience. We also are working on an open source course platform called <a href="#">OpenCourse</a> - that we hope will revolutionize the online learning industry.</p>
			
			<p>As far as new projects go, we are currently <a href="mailto:carlton.dain.miller@gmail.com">open and accepting new clients</a>. Though, we are very selective with whom we work.</p>
			
			<p>Our previous clients include <a href="#">Frontier Communications [ISP]</a>, <a href="#">The World Bank [Climate Change Group]</a>, <a href="#">Major League Baseball</a>, <a href="#">The Hallmark Channel</a>, a <a href="#">food delivery platform [Fooda]</a>, <a href="#">the second largest bidding platform in the United States [uBid]</a>, <a href="#">the March of Dimes</a>, and <a href="">many hospitals</a> and <a href="">medical centers</a>. </p>
				
				<p>We like helping people that are helping others.</p>

			<h2 id="driver">Technical Startup Advisor</h2>
			<p>
				Over the years, I've given personal advice to 30+ entrepreneurs, and more than 15 startup founders have worked with me to improve their digital marketing, branding, and innovation strategies. After this started informally in 2014, I formalized this into the <a href="https://www.technicaladvisorsfund.ml/">Technical Advisors Fund</a>. I've also worked with 3-4 Government agencies to improve their innovation and/or ability to hire top tech talent. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a huge passion of mine, but I only spend 5-10% of my time doing this on any given month as I still like to actively operate in companies/startups before I get too old. But, one day in the future, this will be what I do full-time. 
			</p>
			
			<p>To be completely transparent, we don't have any investments in startups as of 2020. All of our work has been in advising companies and helping founders. But we named it "Technical Advisors <i>Fund</i>" because one day we hope to invest in startups.</p>
				
			<p>Here's a snapshot of our advisorship resume thus far...</p>

				My favorite programming language is Ruby <strong>BY FAR</strong>. I have so much passion for this language, and it gives me so much joy in life to write Ruby code - to the extent that writing Ruby code is my #1 hobby. Outside of Ruby, though, I enjoy working with Python for science-based code. I enjoy Go and Rust, and some other system languages like Scala.
